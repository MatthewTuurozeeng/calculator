#  Simple JavaScript Calculator

On-Screen Calculator A simple and fully functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project combines core web development skills to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) through an interactive on-screen interface.


This project is a **simple web-based calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It performs basic arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, and **division**. The goal of this project is to practice DOM manipulation, user interaction handling, and implementing custom logic for calculator operations *without using built-in math functions* like `eval()`.

## Features

- Supports basic operations: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- Includes buttons for digits (0–9), decimal point, clear, backspace, and equals (=)
- Operates on two numbers at a time (like a real calculator)
- Shows a custom error message when attempting to divide by 0
- Prevents invalid input such as multiple decimals in one number
- Automatically rounds long decimal results to fit in the display
- Allows users to type inputs using their **keyboard**
- Resets display when starting a new calculation after a result
- Includes visual styling with responsive and layout

## Skills I am Practicing and Learning

- Writing custom arithmetic functions in JavaScript (e.g., `add()`, `subtract()`, etc.)
- Implementing a calculator logic without using `eval()` or Math shortcuts
- Using DOM methods to:
  - Select elements with `querySelector`, `getElementById`, etc.
  - Add event listeners to buttons and keyboard input
  - Dynamically update the calculator screen
-  Managing application state with variables (`first_number`, `operator`, etc.)
- Handling user interaction and edge cases (e.g., division by zero, multiple operator presses)
- Creating a responsive and styled layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Building UI behavior from scratch (backspace, clear, chaining operations)
- Writing clean, modular, and reusable code

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – structure of the calculator
- **CSS** – styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – logic, state management, and interactivity

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Click the calculator buttons or use your keyboard to input numbers and operations.

## Limitations

- Only supports basic operations between two numbers at a time.
- Does not yet support parentheses or advanced operations like square roots or exponents.

##  Possible Future Enhancements

- Add memory functions (M+, MR, MC)
- Add scientific calculator mode
- Add history of calculations
- Switch between light and dark themes
- Improve accessibility with ARIA attributes
